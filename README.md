# Vietnam Vitality: A Locality-Driven Exploration of GRDP, Population, and Medical Facilities

## Introduction
### Background and Motivation
Vietnam, a dynamic country with a rich cultural heritage, experiences ongoing economic growth and demographic changes. 
Understanding the interplay between population dynamics, economic prosperity (as measured by GRDP), and healthcare infrastructure is crucial for informed decision-making. 

### Objectives
The overarching goal of this data visualization project is to gain insights into the interplay between population, GRDP (Gross Regional Domestic Product), 
and healthcare infrastructure in Vietnam. To accomplish this, the project aims to answer the following key questions:
Research Questions:
How does GRDP correlate with population growth in different regions of Vietnam?
Are there disparities in healthcare access across localities based on GRDP levels?

Our primary goal revolves around creating website features that effectively showcase data to the audience, 
and ensure data-driven insights from various angles, ensuring an objective analysis.
